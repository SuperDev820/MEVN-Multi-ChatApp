@@- Adding avatar after second login does not work
@@- Dropdown menu for ban/block not implemented at `Private room`
@@- Offline users should not be displayed at `All Users` list. This makes no sense and just clutters the column. 
@@- Green notification of new private messages should be hyperlinked to the relevant screen in private room. That is: When Bob PMs Mary, Mary should be able to go directly to chat with Bob, by clicking on the notification toast.

@@- Add a 'Private Message' item to dropdown menu above block/ban.  When it is clicked, Bob can directly PM Mary from inside any room. The pm message is written at the same input field of the room, with a sign before the message indicating it is a PM directed at Mary.


Step 6

Functionalites
@@- Correct stats of `Users online`  at the `rooms` page. Currently it shows total number of users.
@@- When a user joins a room it should immediately appear in `Online Users` list of other users in the room. 

@@- Flood control is ineffective. When user reaches the maximum message quota, he should be banned for BAN_TIME. Currently just gets a warning message
@@- The time that user is banned should be indicated to the user, like this: You are posting a lot. Wait for $BAN_TIME (unit in minuts) before you can post again.
@@-When the Bio or Location texts are too long and they are not saved, show a notificaiton indicating why the profile has not been saved. 
@@- When a profile is successfully update, show a success notifcation message: 'Your profile is updated'
@@- Remove the red and green borders around the user in `User's list` with whom user is not chatting. They are just cofusing
@@- What's the difference between 'ban' and 'block` for user A and B in room C where neither user A or B is C's admin? If there is no difference, then use a single `ignore` option instead of 'ban' and 'block'. 
    In public room, if the room admin blocks one user, all of his messages are deleted and he is kicked out of the room.
                    if the room admin bans one user, he can enter the room and can read the messages but he can't post any message.
    In private room, if 'userA' blocks 'userB', they cannot send a message to each other.
                     if 'userA' bans 'userB', they can have a private chat but if 'userA' is in another room, he won't be notified when 'userB' sends a private message.
                     He will be notified by only unbanned users's private messages.

@@- Change cursor to pointer when user hovers over a PM notificaiton

@@- remove ad zone from below the input field. 
@@- When a user is blocked in private room the red conversation buble near his name should also be removed.

Step 7/b
@@- ban/Unban has no effect in private room.
